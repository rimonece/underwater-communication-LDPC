Network Scenario
This code simulates a multi-hop underwater communication system, where a transmitter communicates with a receiver over an underwater acoustic channel. The scenario involves:

Nodes:

Multiple nodes are placed at varying distances and depths, simulating a real underwater environment.
Channel:

An underwater acoustic channel introduces noise and attenuation to the transmitted signals. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is varied to analyze performance under different channel conditions.
Modulation:

Supports multiple modulation schemes: BPSK, QPSK, FSK, and 16-QAM.
Modulation affects how data is encoded into waveforms for transmission.
Error Correction:

Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) coding is used to encode messages, improving reliability by correcting errors introduced during transmission.
Performance Metrics:

The system evaluates:
Bit Error Rate (BER): Fraction of incorrectly decoded bits.
Frame Error Rate (FER): Fraction of frames with errors.
Success Rate: Percentage of error-free transmissions.

Use Case:

This scenario is suitable for underwater sensor networks, environmental monitoring, or underwater IoT applications where reliability and efficiency are critical.
